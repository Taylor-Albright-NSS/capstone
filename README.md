# Capstone: Galvadia Character Builder

A support application used to create, store, and test weapons for my game, Galvadia. It's primary use is to help me keep track of every weapon and to adjust weapon damage in-game by testing them in the damage simulator, though, a regular user could find this application useful if they have a character that they want to test weapons out with.
