Create Item view has Edit Item heading
When deleting a character, also delete the character_items relationships
When selecting a race, implement getting race and class stats from the database rather than setting them manually

Remove hands from being able to be selected in all items, editor, and character builder
Move character builder button from character sheet to character list
In the all items view, add a weapon skill to each item so you can see whether it is onehanded, twohanded, etc

Implement the inability to assign negative numbers to stat and damage values: creating item, editing item, character builder
Maybe make it so that character builder view isn't even available to look at until you have a character selected.


ItemSelector.css has commented out code that works well for responsiveness of larger screens that shrink,
but messed up the small screen view of the items in the select items list
